**A simple problem that was causing noticeable performance issues for an old react app.**

```jsx
import { v4 } from "uuid";
const example = ({ items }) => {
  return items.map((i) => {
    return <div key={v4()}>{items.text}></div>;
  });
};
```

At first glance this seems innocuous enough, a simple call to get an ID for a list item. I assumed `v4()` was doing something clever to ensure it was getting consistent keys. Having recently taken over the project I made a note to investigate it later and moved on to a more urgent task. ** _Spoiler:_ ooooh boy, this was not something clever.**

In the context of [rendering a list of objects](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html),
the key prop is used to help React track items in a list as they are updated, added, or removed. When quickly iterating on a project you've probably seen the below error.

<br />

<ConsoleErrorComponent>
  Warning: Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop.
</ConsoleErrorComponent>

<br />

The [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) have thoroughly documented how to properly generate a key prop for an item in an array. Ultimately, the best case is to derive the key from the list item itself.

<br />

```jsx
const ExampleList = ({ data }) => {
  return data.map((d) => {
    return <Example key={d.id} {...d}></Example>;
  });
};

const data = [
  {id: '1',...},
  {id: '2',...},
  {id: '3',...}
]

<ExampleList data={data} />;
```

<br />

Back to our issue, by calling `v4()` as part of the map function, we're guaranteeing a different id for each render. If a single item changes we're telling react to **re-render the whole list from scratch**, as _none_ of the keys will match. This will cause a significant amount of noise in the UI. This ironically silences React's warning about setting a key prop, even though the above snippet has similar if not _worse_ performance than not setting one at all.

<br />

Our contrived example causes a lot of re-renders, but wouldn't cause that many problems with a static set of props. Some of the project's other technical debt exacerbated this problem... You don't need to dig too far into the example below. Re-rendering a list of items often re-fetches its content eg. images. With a noisy redux store, things get out of hand quickly.

```jsx
import { v4 } from "uuid";
import connect from "react-redux";
import * as s from "./selectors";

const ExampleCart = ({
  header,
  costTotal,
  secondsUntilOfferExpires,
  items,
}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{header}</h1>
      <h2>{costTotal}</h2>
      <h3>
        <strong>Act now!</strong>you have {timeUntilOfferExpires} seconds.{" "}
      </h3>
      {items.map((i) => {
        return (
          <div key={v4()}>
            <h1>{item.name}</h1>
            <img src={item.cart_img} />
          </div>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  header: s.getHeaderForStore(state),
  costTotal: s.getTotalForCart(state),
  timeUntilOfferExpires:
    s.getTimeOfferExpires(state) - new Date().getTime() / 1000, // Don't do this
  items: s.getItemsForCart(state),
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(ExampleCart);
```

Any ways, you never quite know what you're going to get when working with existing web applications, but you'd be surprised how often there are **low-hanging big-wins** if you have a solid understanding of the basics.
