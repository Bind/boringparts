In the context of [rendering lists in react](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html), the key prop is used so that React can track the element across render cycles, to try and prevent a re-render.

<br />

```jsx
const ExampleList = ({ data }) => {
  return data.map((d) => {
    return <Example key={d.id} {...d}></Example>;
  });
};

const data = [
  {id: '1',...},
  {id: '2',...},
  {id: '3',...}
]

<ExampleList data={data} />;
```

<br />

By running the key generation as part of the map function, you're guaranteeing a different id for each render, and missing out on performance gains. Across our web app, we see images flash as part of lists. My hunch is that they are re-rendering and re-fetching the image due to this issue.

```jsx
import { v4 } from "uuid";
const example = ({ items }) => {
  return items.map((i) => {
    return <div key={v4()}>{items.text}></div>;
  });
};
```
